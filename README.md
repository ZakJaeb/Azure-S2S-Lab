<h1>Azure S2S VPN Tunnel to Homelab</h1>

<!-- ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo) -->

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I configured an IPSec connection from my Azure tenant to my homelab environment. After successful configuration I was able to RDP into an Azure VM using its private 10.0 IP. I then performed a ping request back to the machine in my home environment using its private 192.168 IP.

Within Azure I deployed a Virtual Network with two subnets, one for the Gateway and another for the VM. I setup a Virtual Network Gateway with a Public IP to route traffic over the S2S tunnel. I configured a Local Network Gateway to represent my homelab network and setup the VPN connection with Shared key.

For my on-premise gateway I used a TP-Link ER605 Gigabit VPN Router. I also used a TP-Link access point to connect my Macbook Air to the internal network. I configured the IPsec tunnel on my TP-Link router by providing the Azure Public IP and Shared Key.

After verifying that the tunnel was enabled and operational, I used Microsoft Remote Desktop to RDP into a Windows Server 2022 VM I had setup earlier. To test further, I pinged my Macbook from the Windows Server VM.

This project was a great way to learn all about configuring simple networks in Azure and how an enterprise might use a very similar approach for a hybrid cloud environment.
